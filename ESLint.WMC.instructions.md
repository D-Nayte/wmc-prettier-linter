# Initialize package for usage

## You have to initialize ESLint for your project just once. To do so, type:

- `npm run wmcInit`

in your terminal to set up ESLint for your project.

Now, your code is automatically checked and formatted while you write. Upon committing the code to GitHub, all modified files are rechecked. If any issues are found during the check, the code commit is aborted, and errors are reported.

---

## You can also manually check your code by entering:

- `npm run wmcLint`

in your terminal.
